  The Elements of Typographic Style</a>
  by Robert Bringhurst, published by Hartley and Marks Publishers - Link is to 4th edition.
  I have the 3rd edition (978-0881792065) and it is a work of art. It is a perfect-bound paperback with
  the uncommon size of 9.2" x 5.4". The paper is Glatfelter Laid, archival and acid free. It's cream 
  with an interesting dashed line ehhh, embossing for lack of a better word, this is what is known as
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laid_paper">Laid</a>. The text face is Minion Pro.
